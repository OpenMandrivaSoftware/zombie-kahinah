Hey there,

Here's an automated update from the Kahinah QA bot, detailing all the actions it thinks happened
over the past 12 hours. If Kahinah was updated recently, some lists may be missing; see the Kahinah
website at {{.KahinahURL}} for more details.

---

{{range .Lists}}
- {{.Name}}-{{.SourceEVR}} ({{.Architecture}}), for {{.Platform}}/{{.Repo}} is now status {{.Status}}.
{{$.KahinahURL}}/builds/{{.Id}}
{{end}}

---

See nothing above? Nothing happened, then. (Although, double check the website to be sure.)

Please note: due to current limitations, QA Clear actions are not marked here. They are considered 'rejected'
in the system, but in reality ABF has not been touched and so they may be re-imported into Kahinah or cleared
from the system, if Kahinah has been (wrongly) bypassed.

Cheers,
Zombie-Kahinah
